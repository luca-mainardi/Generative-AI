# Generative AI Models (2AMU20) Assignments

This repository contains two assignments developed for the Generative AI Models course (2AMU20) at Eindhoven University of Technology. The assignments focus on advanced techniques in generative AI, specifically utilizing autoregressive models with transformers and variational auto-encoders.

### Assignment 1: Autoregressive Models with Transformers

In this assignment, we developed autoregressive models using transformers. The focus was on leveraging the power of transformer architectures to build models capable of generating sequences of data, such as text or time-series data, with high accuracy and coherence.

### Assignment 2: Variational Auto-Encoders

The second assignment involved building and training variational auto-encoders (VAEs). The objective was to learn latent representations of data, allowing for efficient data generation and exploration of the learned latent space. This assignment included tasks such as designing the encoder and decoder networks, training the VAE, and evaluating its performance on various datasets.
